  summary: "Comprehensive analysis of the development test suite validates that NEURONAS acts as a cognitive multiplier. It is not a separate model, but a validation layer that unlocks the underlying LLM's latent capabilities. The 'boost' observed is the realization of the model's own potential through structured debate and validation.",
  keyFindings: [
    {
      title: "Unlocking Latent Ethical Reasoning",
      content: "For queries requiring deep ethical nuance (e.g., ETH-002), the NEURONAS layer facilitated a 15-20% boost in reasoning scores compared to the baseline model output. The architecture forced the underlying model to explore paradoxes it would otherwise gloss over, effectively 'waking up' its dormant reasoning faculties.",
      recommendation: "Use a 3-persona configuration to maximize this latent capability extraction for complex ethical tasks."
    },
    {
      title: "Efficiency of Enhancement",
      content: "For standard informational queries (e.g., STD-001), a lightweight 2-persona validation layer provided a 'Moderate Boost' sufficient to correct hallucinations without incurring excessive latency. This demonstrates that the architecture can be tuned to provide high enhancement efficiency (ΔV) rather than just raw power.",
      recommendation: "Keep the validation layer minimal for standard tasks to maintain a high boost-per-second ratio."
    },
    {
      title: "Diminishing Returns on Simple Recall",
      content: "For simple factual recall, the baseline model already operates near peak capacity. Adding the NEURONAS validation layer offered negligible improvement ('Diminishing Returns'), proving that the architecture should be selectively applied where latent capabilities actually need unlocking.",
      recommendation: "Bypass the validation layer for simple queries where the baseline model is sufficient."
    }
  ],
  nextSteps: "Future development will focus on a 'Capability Router' that predicts the potential boost a query might receive from the validation layer, applying NEURONAS only when a significant enhancement of the underlying model is probable."
